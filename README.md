# DeepReef AI — Coral Health & Bleaching Prediction System

DeepReef AI is an AI-powered system designed to analyze coral reef images and related environmental parameters to evaluate coral health.  
The system predicts whether coral is Healthy or Bleached, estimates bleaching severity levels, and generates an evidence-based scientific summary using Google Gemini.

This project aims to support marine researchers, conservation agencies, and environmental monitoring organizations by providing early insight into reef health conditions.

## Problem Statement

Coral bleaching events are increasing due to rising sea temperatures and climate change.  
Traditional reef monitoring relies on manual observation, which is slow, subjective, and resource-intensive.

DeepReef AI offers automated reef image assessment and contextual interpretation, enabling faster and more informed decision-making for conservation efforts.
